# Multi-Object-Tracking-with-Deep-OC-SORT
data-driven analysis of multi-object tracking algorithms using the Deep OC-SORT framework, focusing on quantifying performance metrics and extracting actionable insights from large-scale video datasets. This project emphasized statistical evaluation and performance optimization rather than just algorithm implementation.
